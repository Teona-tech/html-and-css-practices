In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet">Internet</a>-based <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext'>hypertext</a> system.

    <strong>HTML</strong> 3.2 was published as a W3C Recommendation. It was the first version developed and standardized exclusively by the <strong>W3C</strong>, as the <strong>IETF</strong> had closed its <strong>HTML Working Group</strong> on September 12, 1996.
​Initially code-named "Wilbur", <strong>HTML</strong> 3.2 dropped math formulas entirely, reconciled overlap among various proprietary extensions and adopted most of Netscape's visual markup tags. <b><i>Netscape's blink</i></b> element and <b><i>Microsoft's </i></b>marquee element were omitted due to a mutual agreement between the two companies.
</p>

<p> A markup for mathematical formulas similar to that in HTML was not standardized until 14 months later in MathML.</p>
